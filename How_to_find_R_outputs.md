# Reasons 
Github is not allowed to upload files larger than 100 MB, and recommend all files less than 50 MB. However, half of my results files are larger than this.

# Solution
I will give you the directory of my results, please find the results in the server

# Path to Results
/home/rstudio/R_Works/outputs
